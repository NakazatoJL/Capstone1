      Hello, my name is Lucas Nakazato Jamur, I am a programmer graduated in
      Game Development which didn't fit well into the industry of games, but
      still loves programming, as of this year (2023) I have been studying other
      possibilities for applying my skills and found passion in web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hobbies include a balanced mix of gaming, animes and working out. I
      also have interest in historical documentaries and financial knowledge.
